Introduction to Dart Programming Language :
-------------------------------------------

Dart is an open-source programming language originally developed by Google. 
It is meant for both the server side as well as the user side. 
The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the Dart VM and a utility dart2js which is meant for generating the Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart. 

Note: Dart is an Object-oriented language and is quite similar to that of Java Programming. Dart is extensively used to create single-page websites and web applications. 
The Best example of a dart application is Gmail.

Features of Dart Programming Language :
--------------------------------------

Easy to Understand:
------------------
Dart because of its similarities with C# and Java user often find the Dart Syntax Familiar , Also, as it provides the code Reuse it makes the Programs clean and easy to understand.
Object Oriented Programming:
---------------------------
Nowadays OOPS is considered as one of the most important feature for many Programming Language including Java and C++. Now, Dart which is following the same path of OOPS .
Open Source:
------------ 
As Dart is Open Source which makes it quite popular between the Indivisual and also for few big Organisations.
Browser Support:
----------------
Dart Supported by all the browser because of its dart2js compiler that converts dart Program into JavaScript code which can be further processed by all the modern web browsers.
Type Safe:
---------
Dart is considered as type safe as it is the combination of static and runtime checks to ensure the variable value matches the variable type.
Flexible Compilation and Execution: 
-----------------------------------
Dart Compilation is flexible as it supports both JIT(Just-in-Time) compilation as well as AOT(Ahead of Time) compilation. And dart2js adds extra value to it.
Asynchronous Programming:
-------------------------
Dart Supports Asynchronous Programming is where even when a Primary set of tasks are running , Program will respond to other set of tasks and at the end of the execution a final result will be returned.



Dart Programming Language for Flutter :
=======================================
Flutter is a open sourceSDK(Software Development Kit) provided by Google for creating Native Interfaces. Flutter Framework which creates Flutter Applications for Android , Web and IOS uses Dart as its official Programming Language. Where Dart helps Flutter to avoid the need of separate declarative layout languages( i.e. JSX and XML) , as the layout of Dart has redability which makes it user friendly.

Note: Flutter is a popular for FrontEnd development.

Extension = abc.dart

First Dart Program =>
---------------------
void main(){
    print("Hello Dart Bhai"); // Print method doesn't provide new line
    stdout.write("Hello g kaise ho"); // always provides new line
}

stdout= Standard Output

stdout.write(" "); // always provides new line
print(" "); // doesn't provide new line

stdin.readLineSync()!
---------------------
stdin.readLineSync()!= reads perticular line . its a function , takes string values only
---------------------

void main() = Nothing returns

int main() = returns integer values

main() =  program starts from main function

() = parenthesis , isme hm parameters pass krte hain

{} iska mtlb hota hai ki mera jo program hai wo is curly bracets k andar se start hoga

! = null check // iska mtlb koi bhi value user se null nhi aayega
? = question mark // iska mtlb ki value null aa bhi sakti hai aur nhi bhi aa sakti hai


Note :The dart program can also be compile through terminal by executing the code dart file_name.dart. 


Comments : Comments are the non executable statements.
---------
Two types comments: 
1.Single line comments
2.Multiline line comments


Data Types :
------------
Numbers (int, double)
Strings (String)
Booleans (bool)
Records ((value1, value2))
Functions (Function)
Lists (List, also known as arrays)
Sets (Set)
Maps (Map)
Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
Symbols (Symbol)
The value null (Null)
