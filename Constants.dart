  In Dart language, Constants are objects whose values cannot be changed during the execution of the program. Hence, they are a type of immutable object. A constant cannot be reassigned any value if a value has been assigned to it earlier. If we try to reassign any value to a constant, Dart throws an exception. 

  In Dart language, we can define constants by using 2 keywords :

  1.final keyword
  2.const keyword
